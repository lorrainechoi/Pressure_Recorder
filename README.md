Pressure recorder is a arduino-python synthesizer that records pressure from different touch pads and plot real-time pressure data on the computer locally. Volume of output sound is determined by the amount of pressure applied on touch pads.

# Prerequisites
1. You will need Python 2.7 installed on your system.
2. Run: `git clone https://github.com/lorrainechoi/Pressure_Recorder` to clone the repo and then `cd Pressure_recorder` to navigate into the directory
3. Install Arduino IDE and upload the `test_midi.ino` file to the board
4. Install Python dependencies: `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `serial`, `fluidsynth`
